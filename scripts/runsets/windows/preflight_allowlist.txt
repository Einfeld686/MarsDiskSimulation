# Allowlist for preflight cmd lint
# Format: <path-glob>::rule1,rule2
# - Matching is case-insensitive (paths are normalized to lowercase with '/' separators).
# - Patterns use fnmatch-style globs; '*' can span directories (e.g. *.cmd matches nested files).
# - Patterns are matched against both repo-relative and absolute paths.
# - Full suppression requires an explicit "*": use "::*".
# - Use "::rule1,rule2" to suppress specific rules only.
# - Lines without "::" (or with empty rules) are ignored and reported as warnings.
# Example: scripts/runsets/windows/run_one.cmd::cmd.line_endings.mixed
# Example: scripts/**/legacy/*.cmd::*
scripts/runsets/windows/legacy/*.cmd::*
