# Allowlist for preflight cmd lint
# Format: <path-glob>[::rule1,rule2]
# - Matching is case-insensitive (paths are normalized to lowercase with '/' separators).
# - Patterns use fnmatch-style globs; '*' can span directories (e.g. *.cmd matches nested files).
# - Patterns are matched against both repo-relative and absolute paths.
# - Omit ::rules (or use path::) to suppress all rules for that path.
# - Use "::rule1,rule2" to suppress specific rules only.
# Example: scripts/runsets/windows/run_one.cmd::cmd.line_endings.mixed
# Example: scripts/**/legacy/*.cmd::*
# Example: scripts/runsets/windows/run_one.cmd
