ABSTRACT
We study the outﬂow of dust particles on the surface layers of optically thick disks. At the surface of disks
around young stars, small dust particles (size d10 lm) experience stellar radiation pressure support and orbit
more slowly than the surrounding gas. The resulting tailwind imparts energy and angular momentum to the
dust particles, moving them outward. This outﬂow occurs in the thin surface layer of the disk that is exposed
to starlight, and the outward mass ﬂux is carried primarily by particles of size 0.1 lm. Beneath the
irradiated surface layer, dust particles experience a headwind, which drives them inward. For the speciﬁc case
of a minimum-mass solar nebula, less than a thousandth of the dust mass experiences outward ﬂow. If the
stellar luminosity is 15 times brighter than the Sun, however, or if the gas disk mass is as small as 100 M,
then the surface outﬂow can dominate the inward ﬂux in certain radial ranges, leading to the formation of
rings or gaps in the dust disks.

1. INTRODUCTION
Circumstellar disks around young stars are composed of
gas and dust particles, and in general, the dust and gas
accretion velocities are not equal. The gas suﬀers turbulent
viscosity and accretes onto the central star on a viscous
timescale of the order of 106–107 yr (Hartmann et al. 1998).
The orbital evolution of dust particles, on the other hand, is
controlled by gas drag (Adachi, Hayashi, & Nakazawa
1976; Weidenschilling 1977).
Several factors aﬀect the radial motion of particles. First,
gas drag in the radial direction entrains particles in the
accretion ﬂow. When the gas density is high or when the
particle size is small, the particles follow the gas motion and
accrete onto the star on the viscous timescale. Second, angu-
lar momentum is transferred between particles and the gas.
The radial gas pressure gradient shifts the angular velocity
of the gas slightly from the Keplerian value. Moreover, if
starlight can irradiate particles, then radiation pressure
causes non-Keplerian deviations in the particle velocity as
well. Dust particles can thus gain or lose angular momen-
tum through gas drag and thus move outward or inward,
depending on whether they experience a net headwind or a
net tailwind.
In a previous paper (Takeuchi & Lin 2002, hereafter
Paper I), we studied particle motion in optically thick disks,
using the assumption that radiation pressure on the dust is
negligible. We found that dust particles smaller than 10 lm
accrete with smaller velocity than the gas. As the gas accre-
tion proceeds, small dust particles are left behind in the disk,
and the dust-to-gas ratio gradually increases. Because cir-
cumstellar disks associated with young stars are generally
optically thick, the majority of dust particles are not directly
exposed to stellar radiation, and the approximation used in
Paper I is applicable. There are always, however, some par-
ticles near the disk surfaces that are directly irradiated, and
the motion of such particles is aﬀected by radiation pres-
sure. Klahr & Lin (2001) and Takeuchi & Artymowicz
(2001) studied the motion of particles in optically thin gas
disks around young Vega-type stars, where the dust experi-
ences both gas drag and radiation pressure. Because the
radiation pressure reduces the angular velocity of the dust
below that of the gas, the dust tends to move outward. Thus,
in a more reﬁned description of an optically thick disk, one
expects that particles in the irradiated surface layer move
outward, while beneath the surface layer, particles move
inward. If the surface outﬂow dominates the midplane
inﬂow, then there is a net radial expansion that may induce
the formation of rings or gaps.
In this paper, we study the surface dust outﬂow in opti-
cally thick disks due to radiation pressure. The mass ﬂux of
the surface outﬂow is calculated, which is compared with
that of the inﬂow inside the disk. We ﬁnd that the surface
outﬂow is negligible in a minimum-mass solar nebula model
but that the surface outﬂow can dominate inﬂow at some
disk radii in some cases, including situations involving
high stellar luminosity or low gas mass. In such disks, the
appearance of rings or gaps is expected.
2. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE GAS AND THE DUST
2.1. The Gas Disk
We consider circumstellar disks around young pre–main-
sequence stars. The disks are turbulent and are accreting
onto the central stars, but they are assumed to be passive;
that is, the disks are primarily heated by stellar radiation
only. When turbulent ﬂuctuations are averaged out, the
mean gas motion is nearly in hydrostatic equilibrium, and
the radial accretion ﬂow is much slower than the azimuthal
Kepler rotation. In cylindrical coordinates (r, h, z), the
balance of forces in the r- and z-directions is

is isothermal in the vertical direction. The temperature

2.2. The Dust Disk
2.2.1. Radial Distribution
The radial surface density distribution of the dust is
assumed to be proportional to that of the gas disk, so that
d;allðrÞ ¼ fdustgðrÞ, where the constant fdust is the dust-
to-gas mass ratio. Throughout the paper, we adopt the
value fdust ¼ 0:01 at all radii. The subscript ‘‘ all ’’ represents
contributions from the entire distribution of particle sizes.
In this paper, we consider cases in which all particles have
the same size and also power-law size distributions. For
power-law size distributions, the size range is bracketed at
the large and small ends, [smin, smax]. We adopt a power-law
index of 3.5, appropriate to the distribution expected
following collisional evolution (Hellyer 1970). The surface
number density of particles in a size range [s, s þ ds] at a
distance r from the star is given by

smax ¼ 1 lm.
2.2.2. Vertical Distribution
Dust particles feel the z-component of the stellar gravity
and thus sediment toward the disk midplane. Small particles
(sd1 cm) immediately (within one orbit) reach the terminal
velocity vz;d, where the gravity and the gas drag are in bal-
ance. For the small particles considered here (sd1 cm),
Epstein’s drag law is applied, because the mean free path of
the gas molecules (7 cm at 1 AU) is larger than the particle
size. The gas drag force is
Fg ¼ 4
3 gs2vtðvd  vgÞ ;
ð12Þ
where vt is the mean thermal velocity of the gas molecules
and vd and vg are the velocities of the dust and the gas,
respectively. The stopping time due to the gas drag is
ts ¼ mdjvd  vgj=jFgj,
where
md ¼ 4=3

normalized by the orbital time as
Ts ¼ tsK;mid ¼ psvK;mid
grvt
;
ð13Þ
where vK;mid is the Keplerian velocity at the midplane. When
terminal velocity is achieved, the gas drag balances the z-
component of the stellar gravity, md2
Kz. Using the
approximation K  K;mid, the terminal velocity vz;d is
vz;d ¼ K;midTsz :
ð14Þ
The mass ﬂux of particles in the vertical direction is
fz;sed ¼ dvz;d ;
ð15Þ
where d is the dust mass density. If the gas disk were lami-
nar, the particles would concentrate at the midplane in a
time that is short compared to the evolution time of the gas
disk (the sedimentation timescale is about 106 yr for 1 lm
particles at 10 AU). When the gas disk is turbulent, how-
ever, the gas stirs and disperses the particles and prevents
sedimentation. The mass ﬂux of dust arising from this tur-
bulent diﬀusion is assumed proportional to the gradient of
the dust concentration d=g in analogy with molecular dif-
fusion (e.g., Monin & Yaglom 1971, p. 579; Morﬁll 1985,

As discussed in Paper I, the sedimentation of particles is
more eﬀective for larger particles and at larger distances
from the star. As the distance increases, the dust disk
becomes relatively thinner compared to the gas disk.
2.3. Optical Depth from the Star
The disks considered in this paper are optically thick at
visible wavelengths, even in the vertical direction (ver  100
at 100 AU). Stellar light cannot penetrate the dust disk.
Only particles residing in the thin surface layer are exposed
to stellar radiation pressure.

dust disk is

where z0 ¼ ðz=rÞr0, rin is the inner edge of the dust disk, and
 is the dust opacity in the visible wavelength for a unit mass
of the gas. The opacity for a unit mass of the dust is =fdust.
In our calculations, we adopt rin ¼ 0:1 AU. This choice of
inner boundary does not aﬀect the integral in equation (20),
because the dust disk is ﬂared and the main contribution to
the optical depth comes from the dust at relatively large dis-
tances from the star. We adopt a dust mass opacity  ¼ 100
cm2 g1 for visible wavelengths. For particles smaller than
100 lm, the opacity is independent of (the maximum) par-
ticle size (see Figs. 5 and 11 in Miyake & Nakagawa 1993).
Thus, we need not consider variations in  with changes in
the particle size.
Figure 1 shows the disk surfaces at which the optical
depth to the starlight is unity. Above these illuminated sur-
faces, the dust particles are directly exposed to the stellar
radiation. Figure 1a shows the illuminated surfaces of the
standard disk models, which are composed of single-sized
particles (0.1–10 lm). As the particle size increases, the level
of the illuminated surfaces becomes lower. This size depen-
dence is because larger particles sediment more readily and
thus concentrate near the midplane. The illuminated
surfaces have a slightly ﬂatter geometry than the gas disk,
because the dust particles at larger distances sediment more
eﬀectively. Figure 1b shows the illuminated surfaces of the
models containing power-law size distributions. The illumi-
nated surfaces lie at roughly 3 disk scale heights, which are
similar to those of the single-sized 0.1 lm particles. The
location of the illuminated surface does not change signiﬁ-
cantly with the maximum size of the particles, because the
high altitude above the midplane is mostly populated by the
smallest particles.
3. OUTFLOW IN THE SURFACE LAYER
Dust particles above the illuminated surface suﬀer radia-
tion pressure from the central star. The radiation pressure
balances a part of the stellar gravity, so that the small
particles orbit slower than the gas. Because the gas drag

the particles move outward, leading to an outﬂow in the sur-
face layers of the dust disks. In this section, we estimate the
mass ﬂuxes carried by these outﬂows.
3.1. Outﬂow Mass Flux
The radiation pressure is expressed through the ratio  to
the stellar gravity. The radial component is

ð21Þ
The value of , which is calculated with Mie’s scattering
theory, depends on the particle composition, porosity,
shape, and size. In this paper, we adopt  for ‘‘ young com-
etary particles,’’ which is calculated by Wilck & Mann
(1996) for typical interplanetary particles in the solar system
and shown in Figure 2. In general, stellar light causes
Poynting-Robertson drag on the particles in addition to the
gas drag induced by radiation pressure. However, in the gas
disks considered here, the gas density is suﬃciently large
that gas drag dominates Poynting-Robertson drag (see
the discussion in Takeuchi & Artymowicz 2001, x 4.2).
Poynting-Robertson drag can therefore be neglected.

100 lm may have  smaller than . For such large par-
ticles, the radiation pressure is unimportant, even if they are
above the illuminated surface. In this section, we consider
only small particles with radii less than 10 lm. Such par-
ticles have nondimensional stopping times Ts5 1 (see Fig. 2

We deﬁne this as the disk evolution time through the inﬂow.
This deﬁnition of tin does not mean the time for carrying the
total dust mass outside r to the inner part, but it is conven-
ient for comparing with tout. Comparison of tout and tin
simply means comparison of the outﬂow and inﬂow ﬂuxes.
The disk clearing through the surface outﬂow occurs eﬀec-
tively only if the surface ﬂux is stronger than the inﬂow ﬂux,
i.e., tout < tin. The comparison of these two timescales is
discussed in xx 3.3 and 3.4 below.
3.2. Evolution Time of the Disks through the Outﬂow
We ﬁrst discuss the disk clearing time tout through the
surface outﬂow. In this subsection we adopt the assumption
that inﬂow ﬂux near the midplane is negligible and that only
the surface ﬂow aﬀects the dust structure within the disk. In
xx 3.3 and 3.4 we relax this assumption and consider more
realistic scenarios including the eﬀects of inﬂow near the
midplane.
The particles in the surface layer have outﬂow velocity
vr;dðr; zsur; sÞ. These particles are blown from their orbits
to larger radii on a timescale tb ¼ r=vr;dðr; zsur; sÞ. For
disks composed of single-sized particles, tb is plotted in
Figure 3. The blow-oﬀtime for 0.1–10 lm particles is about
102 yr at a few AU from the star and is about 105 yr at 100
AU. The blow-oﬀtime is much shorter than the inward
migration time inside the disk, which is discussed in x 3.3
below, because 4 and because the stopping time Ts at the
illuminated surface is much longer than at the midplane.
In our standard model, the dust disk is highly optically
thick. Even in the vertical direction at 100 AU, the optical
depth is ver  100, so the layer above the illuminated sur-
face is very thin. Figure 4 shows the ratio of the surface den-
sity of the layer to that of the whole disk (d;sur;all=d;all). As
the distance from the star increases, the mass ratio increases,
and the surface layer becomes thicker. However, even at 100
AU, the mass of the surface layer is less than 103 times the
dust disk mass. In the case of single-sized particles (Fig. 4a),
the mass of the surface layer is smaller for disks with larger
particle sizes. As the particles grow larger, they sediment
more to the midplane, and the surface layer becomes thin-
ner. On the other hand, for the mixed-sized particles (Fig.
4b), the mass of the surface layer does not vary signiﬁcantly
with the maximum size. Because smaller particles exist at
higher altitudes above the midplane, the surface layer is
composed mainly of the smallest particles, and the quantity
of smallest particles in the surface layer does not vary with
the maximum size.
Although Figure 3 implies that the outﬂow velocity at the
surface layer is high, the outﬂow mass ﬂux is not large
because of the small mass contained in the surface layer.
The disk evolution time tout through the surface outﬂow is
shown in Figure 5a. The evolution time of the disk com-
posed of 0.1 lm particles is about 107 yr at 1 AU and 108 yr
at 100 AU. Thus, in 107 yr, the dust outﬂow mass that has
passed 1 AU becomes comparable to the dust disk mass
inside 1 AU. If the radial motion of the dust disk occurs only
through surface outﬂow, the particles in the innermost part
of the disk will escape from the region inside 1 AU in 107 yr,
and a hole will appear. The hole expands, and in 108 yr, the
radius of the hole reaches 100 AU. There is, however, an

clearing by the accretion ﬂow is discussed in x 3.3 below. As
the particle size increases, the evolution time increases as
well. This is because particles with larger sizes concentrate
more at the midplane, and the surface layer becomes
thinner. The blow-oﬀtime tb for a larger particle at its
surface layer is also larger because of the higher local density
of the gas at the lower surface layer (Fig. 3). If the disk is
composed of 10 lm particles, it takes about 109 yr for a disk

yr at 100 AU. The disk evolution occurs mainly through the
outﬂow of 0.1 lm particles. While the surface layer is com-
posed primarily of the smallest (0.01 lm) particles, these
particles do not receive radiation pressure as eﬀectively as
particles at 0.1 lm (see Fig. 2). Thus, the surface outﬂow is
mainly carried by a minor fraction of particles in the 0.1 lm
range, and the disk evolution time of the mixed-sized
particles is much longer than that of the disk with the single-
sized particles of 0.1 lm. The evolution time increases with
the maximum particle size. The dependence of the maxi-
mum size on the evolution time, however, is not as signiﬁ-
cant as in the case of single-sized particles. For disks
composed of mixed-sized particles, particles of size 0.1 lm
form the main contribution to the surface outﬂow. The
number density of 0.1 lm particles decreases as the maxi-
mum particle size increases. However, because the thickness
of the surface layer is determined by the optical depth from
the star and the opacity comes mainly from 0.1 lm particles,
the total mass of 0.1 lm particles in the surface layer does
not change signiﬁcantly (Fig. 4b). Hence, the outﬂow ﬂux
maintains a relatively constant value.
3.3. Comparison with the Inward Migration Time
The surface outﬂow leads to disk clearing only if it domi-
nates the undersurface inﬂow. The disk evolution timescale
tin through the inﬂow is shown as the dashed lines in Figure
5. As discussed in Paper I, for suﬃciently small particles that
are well coupled to the gas, the inﬂow velocity is similar to
the accretion velocity of the gas. In the standard model,
particles smaller than 1 lm have velocities nearly indistin-
guishable from the gas throughout the disk. Particles of 10
lm decouple from the gas motion at large distances (re50
AU) and have a shorter evolution time than the gas and
smaller particles. The inﬂowing mass ﬂux is much larger (10
times or more) than the mass ﬂux of the surface outﬂow
even for 0.1 lm particles. Therefore, the net mass ﬂux of
particles is dominated by the inﬂow beneath the surface
layer. In the disks composed of mixed-sized particles
(Fig. 5b), the inﬂow also dominates the net ﬂow. The surface
outﬂow has a very minor eﬀect on the disk evolution in our
standard model, regardless of the particle size.
3.4. Various Models
In our standard model, the surface outﬂow is negligible
for disk evolution compared to the inﬂow inside the disk.
This ﬂow outcome is due to the surface layer being very thin,
such that its mass is a small fraction of the entire dust disk
mass. The surface outﬂow may be important under some
conditions for which the surface layer is thicker or the
outﬂow is much faster than the standard model. In this
subsection we consider several models to see under which
conditions the surface outﬂow is important.
3.4.1. High Luminosity
Massive young stars have a larger luminosity-mass ratio.
For example, 2.5 M stars have about 20 L M1
 for 107
yr (D’Antona & Mazzitelli 1994). Under such a high
luminosity-mass ratio, the dust particles are exposed to a
stronger radiation pressure ( is proportional to L=M). Fig-
ure 6a shows the evolution time of the disk in the case in
which the stellar luminosity-mass ratio is 15 times larger
than the standard model. The outﬂow velocity is 15 times
faster than in the standard model, causing the outﬂow mass
ﬂux to dominate the inﬂow at large distances (re200 AU).
In this model, dust particles that are initially outside 200
AU are expelled to larger distances, while particles inside
200 AU are accreted onto the star. It is expected that a gap
around 200 AU will form in 107 yr.

[Error: API Key missing] 3.4.2. Small Disk Mass
If the total dust mass is smaller, the disk optical depth is
smaller, so that the layer above the illuminated surface is
thicker. Figure 6b shows the evolution time of the disks
whose masses are 0.1 and 0.01 times smaller than the stan-
dard disk. The mass ﬂux of the surface outﬂow is almost
independent of the disk mass because the mass of the surface
layer, which is determined by the optical thickness, is
approximately constant. Therefore, the relative importance
of the surface outﬂow, which is proportional to the mass
ratio of the surface layer to the whole disk, increases with
decreasing the total dust mass. The evolution time through
the inﬂow (see the dashed lines) at the inner part of the disk
is similar to that of the standard model, while at the outer
part it decreases with decreasing disk mass. As the disk mass
decreases, the gas density at the outer region of the disk
becomes insuﬃcient to keep dust particles moving together
with the gas. The inward drift velocity of particles relative to
the gas becomes faster for disks with smaller gas mass. For
such drifting particles, the evolution time is proportional to
r2þpq=2 (see Paper I, x 3.3.3), which is constant with r in our
models (p ¼ 2:25 and q ¼ 0:5). For a disk with 1/10 the
mass of the standard model, the evolution time through the
surface outﬂow is still longer than that of the inﬂow. If the
disk is 102 times smaller than the standard model (the gas
mass inside 100 AU is 2:5  104 M ¼ 83 M), the sur-
face outﬂow ﬂux is comparable to the inﬂow ﬂux at around
20 AU. Thus, there is no net ﬂow at radii in the neighbor-
hood of 20 AU. The dust particles initially outside 20 AU
move inward until their migration is terminated at 20 AU.
At the same time, the particles initially inside 20 AU con-
tinue to move inward and accrete onto the star. Therefore,
the particle migration induces accumulation of dust at 20
AU and forms a ring there. Gas disks around young stars
are expected to dissipate in 107 yr (Hartmann et al. 1998).
When the gas mass is reduced to about 100 M, a ring
appears at a radius of a few tens of AU.
3.4.3. High Diﬀusivity of Dust
In the standard model, the diﬀusivity of dust particles
subject to turbulent motion of the gas is assumed to be the
same as the diﬀusivity of the gas; i.e., the Schmidt number
Sc is unity. Experiments show that Sc can be as small as 0.1
and dust particles can be much more diﬀusive than the gas,
if the Stokes number St is of the order of 102 (e.g., Fig. 1 in
Cuzzi et al. 1993). The Stokes number is considered to be of
Fig. 6.—Disk evolution time for various models. The solid and dashed lines correspond to the evolution time through the surface outﬂow and through the
inﬂow inside the disk, respectively. Particles have a power-law size distribution with smax ¼ 1 lm. Parameters are the same as the standard model except for
that (a) The luminosity-mass ratio of the central star is L=M ¼ 15 L M1
 . (b) The disk is less massive. The gas masses inside 100 AU are 2:5  103 M and
2:5  104 M ¼ 83 M from the upper line. (c) The particles are more diﬀusive (Sc ¼ 0:1).

[Error: API Key missing] the same order as the nondimensional stopping time Ts. At
radii of several hundred AU, Ts  102 for 0.1 lm particles
at the illuminated surface (z  3hg). Thus, it is expected that
such particles will spread to higher altitude, where they are
easily blown oﬀ. Figure 6c shows the evolution time for such
particles with Sc ¼ 0:1. The dust particles are more diﬀusive
and are stirred up to higher altitude by turbulence than in
the case of Sc ¼ 1. The illuminated surface is located higher,
where the gas density is lower and the outﬂow velocity is
faster. The outﬂow mass ﬂux, however, is still smaller than
the inﬂow mass ﬂux within rd500 AU. Inﬂow under the
surface layer dominates even for particles with high
diﬀusivity.
3.4.4. Particle Growth
In the above discussion, we mainly used models that have
a power-law size distribution with a maximum size of 1 lm.
The dust particles in circumstellar disks may have evolved
to sizes larger than 1 lm (Beckwith & Sargent 1991;
Mannings
&
Emerson
1994;
D’Alessio,
Calvet,
&
Hartmann 2001). Figure 5b shows the evolution time of the
disks as the maximum size of the particles is varied. The
evolution time through the surface outﬂow does not change
signiﬁcantly, as discussed in x 3.1. The evolution time
through inﬂow inside the disk, however, rapidly decreases
with the growth of particles. At the outer part of the disk
where the gas density is insuﬃcient to keep the largest par-
ticles moving together with the gas, the inﬂow velocity of
the particles is proportional to their size. For the size distri-
bution with a power-law index of 3.5, the dust mass is
dominated by the largest particles, and the inﬂow mass ﬂux
is proportional to the size of the largest particle. The evolu-
tion time through the inﬂow is as small as 105 yr when the
largest particle is 1 mm, which is much shorter than that
through the surface outﬂow. As the particles grow larger,
the surface outﬂow becomes less important for the overall
disk evolution.
4. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY
4.1. Progress in the Disk Evolution
We compared the surface outﬂow ﬂux with the under-
surface inﬂow ﬂux and discussed conditions for disk
clearing. In those comparisons, we assumed the dust density
proﬁles described in x 2 and neglected time variations of the
dust density. In real disks, however, the dust density varies
as the surface outﬂow proceeds. We discuss how density
changes aﬀect the subsequent evolution.
As dust particles above the illuminated surface are blown
oﬀby the stellar radiation, new particles continually diﬀuse
into and replenish this region from below. The diﬀusion
time over which the surface layer is repopulated is
trp  Scð3hgÞ2

 9
 1  103r3=2
AU yr ;
ð35Þ
where we use the fact that the distance between the surface
layer and the midplane is about 3 disk scale heights for
 ¼ 103 and Sc ¼ 1. The diﬀusion time (106 yr at 100 AU)
is much shorter than the disk evolution time tout. Thus, dur-
ing the disk evolution, the dust in the surface layer is
continuously replenished, and the surface outﬂow continues
until the dust in the midplane is depleted.
In disks composed of mixed-sized particles, small (sd0:1
lm) particles constitute the majority of the surface outﬂow.
The small particles are rapidly removed from the disk and
are
continuously
replenished
through
the
collisional
destruction of larger particles. The collisional timescale
tcol ¼ ðs2ndvrelÞ1, where nd is the particle number density
and vrel is the relative velocity of particles, is much shorter
than the disk evolution time. For example, if we assume that
the majority of the dust is composed of 1 cm particles, the
relative velocity is about 10 cm s1 at 1 AU (from Fig. 3 in
Weidenschilling & Cuzzi 1993), and the collisional time is
tcol  103 yr. If the dust is composed of smaller particles, the
collisional time is smaller. The outcome of the collisions,
however, is not well understood, and we do not know how
many small particles are produced through the collisional
destruction. In this paper, we simply assume that the par-
ticle size distribution is in an equilibrium state. The mini-
mum size, the maximum size, and the power-law index of
the distribution do not vary with time. In a realistic situa-
tion, however, at least the maximum size would grow with
time, leading to inhibition of the disk clearing, as discussed
in x 3.4.4. Calculations that take account of dust growth are
needed to solve this issue.
Because the disk evolution time tout is shorter at smaller
radii, the dust outﬂow proceeds from the inner disk. The
particles blown from the inner disk accumulate in the outer
disk. This process increases the dust-to-gas ratio at large
radii. We can ask whether this increase in the dust-to-gas
ratio aﬀects the subsequent disk evolution. Suppose that the
dust particles inside a radius r are removed, and an inner
hole (or a gap) is produced. The removed particles pile up in
an annulus just outside the inner hole. The width of the
annulus is larger than the disk scale height. In the diﬀusion
time trp, the accumulated particles diﬀuse over a few disk
scale heights both in the vertical and in the radial directions,
and during a disk evolution time tout > trp, the particles dif-
fuse even farther. Thus, the surface density of the annulus
increases at most by a factor of r2d;all=ð2rd;alldrÞd
r=hg  10, where drehg  0:1r is the width of the annulus.
Because the gas density does not change, the dust-to-gas
ratio of the annulus becomes d10 times larger. The opacity
, which is deﬁned for a unit mass of the gas and is propor-
tional to the dust-to-gas ratio, also increases by a factor of
the order of d10. (If the particles diﬀuse as far as the inner
hole radius r in a disk evolution time tout, then the hole is
reﬁlled and dust removal is inhibited. The timescale for the
reﬁll is comparable to the gas accretion timescale r2=,
which is shown as the dotted lines in Figure 5. In the stan-
dard model, the reﬁll eﬀectively inhibits the dust removal.
Only in the high stellar luminosity or the low-mass disk
cases can the surface outﬂow dominate the reﬁll.)
Figure 7 shows how the increase in the dust-to-gas ratio
aﬀects the outﬂow mass ﬂux. In Figure 7 the outﬂow ﬂux in
the cases for fdust ¼ 0:1 (i.e., the dust-to-gas ratio is 10 times
larger than the standard model) and for fdust ¼ 103 (10
times smaller dust-to-gas ratio) are shown with the standard
model. It is seen that the outﬂow ﬂux depends only weakly
on the dust-to-gas ratio. The change in the dust-to-gas ratio
has a slight eﬀect on the location of the surface layer, but it
hardly changes the dust mass of the surface layer. The thick-
ness of the surface layer is determined so as to make the
optical depth be unity, and its mass content does not depend
on the dust-to-gas ratio. The variation in the outﬂow ﬂux
arises mainly from change in the location of the surface
No. 1, 2003

## Page 9

[Error: API Key missing] layer and from change in the angle of the incident starlight
to the surface layer, and these eﬀects are small. Therefore,
the accumulation of blown-oﬀparticles increases the dust-
to-gas ratio at the disk edge just outside the inner hole but
does not signiﬁcantly decrease the outﬂow ﬂux there. Even
after the increase in the dust-to-gas ratio in the outer disk,
the surface outﬂow proceeds, and the disk evolution
continues with the timescale plotted in Figures 5 and 6.
4.2. Gap Formation in Herbig Ae/Be Disks
The phenomenon of surface stripping can eﬀectively
evolve the disk structure around young luminous stars
whose luminosity-mass ratios are larger than 15 times the
solar value, as shown in x 3.4.1. In the outer part (e200
AU) of such disks, the surface outﬂow dominates the inﬂow
through the midplane, causing a net outward ﬂow. On the
other hand, within 200 AU, the dust ﬂows inward onto the
central star. Around 200 AU, the dust density decreases.
The outﬂow or inﬂow ﬂux around 200 AU is strong enough
that it can carry the total amount of the dust inside 200 AU
in 107 yr. This ﬂux maintains a relatively constant value
throughout the evolution, even after the dust density and
the dust-to-gas ratio have decreased (see Fig. 7). Conse-
quently, the dust density declines at an almost constant rate.
The timescale for dust diﬀusion to transport dust from the
midplane to replenish the surface layer is about 3  106 yr at
200 AU. We expect that the dust density at 200 AU will
decline considerably in 107 yr.
The formation of gaps can be examined by radio observa-
tions. At 200 AU the gas surface density in the standard
model is g ¼ 1:8 g cm2, which is optically thin in the verti-
cal direction in the radio continuum region around 1 mm
(1 mm  102). Therefore, the density decline will be
observed as a decrease in the optical depth.
The disk is highly optically thick in the visible or near-
infrared light (vis  200 at 200 AU). Thus, the density
decrease is diﬃcult to examine directly using visible or near-
infrared observations. If the gap region is shadowed by the
inner disk, or if the edge of the outer disk is illuminated by
the central star, a variation in the surface irradiation will
probably be observed. There are a few Herbig Ae/Be stars
that show gaps in the scattered-light images of their disks.
The disk around HD 163296 has a dark lane at 325 AU
(Grady et al. 2000). HD 100546 also has a disk with a gap at
250 AU (Grady et al. 2001). In order to make direct compar-
isons with these observations, we need further modeling
that takes account of the time evolution of the dust density
and that incorporates simulated scattered-light images.
In this paper, we discussed gap formation through the
surface stripping caused by radiation pressure. It is useful to
discuss how to distinguish this mechanism from the other
gap-formation processes such as planetary perturbations
(Lin & Papaloizou 1986; Takeuchi, Miyama, & Lin 1996).
Obviously, surface stripping itself cannot generate nonaxi-
symmetric features, whereas an embedded planet can. In
gas-free disks, a planet forms characteristic disk structures
that arise from orbital resonances (Roques et al. 1994;
Dermott et al. 1994; Liou & Zook 1999; Wyatt et al. 1999;
Ozernoy et al. 2000; Wilner et al. 2002; Quillen & Thorndike
2002), and in gas disks the planet excites spiral density
waves (Miki 1982; Sekiya, Miyama, & Hayashi 1987;
Bryden
et
al. 1999; Kley
1999; Lubow, Seibert, &
Artymowicz 1999; Miyoshi et al. 1999; Tanigawa &
Watanabe 2002). The detection of such nonaxisymmetric
features would rule out surface stripping as a gap-formation
mechanism. The other notable feature of surface stripping is
that it does not aﬀect the gas density structure. The gas disks
still have monotonic density structure, even after the dust
disks have formed gaps. Therefore, detection of gaps in gas
disks also rules out surface stripping. In order to explain the
cause of the gaps around HD 163296 and HD 100546, it is
important to determine with future observations whether
their gas disks have gaps or not.
4.3. Summary
Dust particles that are directly irradiated by the star move
outward under the combined action of gas drag and radia-
tion pressure. In this paper, the surface outﬂow of particles
in optically thick disks is studied. Our results are as follows:
1. Particles in the surface layer, which are directly
exposed to the starlight, move outward. In a disk resembling
the minimum-mass solar nebula, the height of the surface
layer is about 3 scale heights of the gas disk, and the mass is
106 times the total dust mass at 1 AU and 104 times the
total dust mass at 100 AU. For this case, the mass ﬂux of the
surface outﬂow is much smaller than the inﬂow mass ﬂux
inside the disk, and the surface outﬂow does not contribute
signiﬁcantly to the dust disk evolution.
2. The surface outﬂow dominates the inﬂow in the fol-
lowing cases: (a) If the luminosity-mass ratio of the central
star is 15 times larger than the solar value, the velocity of the
surface outﬂow is large enough at the outer part of the disk
(re200 AU). (b) If the mass of the gas disk is as small as
102 times the minimum-mass disk (100 M inside 100
AU), the mass ratio of the surface layer to the whole dust
disk is large enough at a few tens of AU. In such cases, the
surface outﬂow induces formation of gaps or rings.
3. The surface outﬂow is mainly composed of particles
with sizes of the order of 0.1 lm. As the particles grow, the
largest particles around the midplane move inward more
rapidly, while the outﬂow ﬂux at the surface remains at a
near-constant value. This results in a diminishing impor-
tance of the surface outﬂow for the overall disk evolution.

and 103 from the upper line. The ﬂux is normalized by the value of the
standard model (fdust ¼ 0:01) at 10 AU.
