# Coverage Snapshot

Baseline thresholds: function reference rate ≥ 70%, anchor consistency rate = 100%.

| Metric | Value | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Function reference rate | 100.0% (109/109) | ≥ 70% |
| Anchor consistency rate | 100.0% (690/690) | = 100% |
| Equation unit coverage | 94.3% (33/35) | — |
| Sinks callgraph documented | Yes | run→surface→sinks→sublimation |
